## ðŸš€ About Me

- Started programming in the mid 90s with following education as computer engineer, a bachelor in Software & Information Engineering and finally a master in Visual Computing at the technical university in Vienna, Austria.

- I came across functional programming during my studies, but only developed a greater interested in 2017 at work, when we ported a big project over to F#. Since than I am hooked and had the fortune to work professionally on different F# projects.

- In my free time I keep experimenting with F#. Mostly coding challenges and some small projects. I have more ideas, than I ever have time for.
